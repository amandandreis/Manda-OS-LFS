# Manda-OS-LFS

## Overview
**Manda-OS** is a customized Linux distribution built from the ground up using Linux From Scratch. This project representsa lot of dedicated work to understand the fundamental components of an operating system. Throughout the process, I have delved into software compilation, package management, and kernel configuration, resulting in a functional system.

### Future Plans
I aim to expand Manda-OS with advanced functionalities focused on cybersecurity. Additionally, I plan to redesign the system to enhance both security and aesthetics, ultimately creating a unique and personalized distribution.
